# todo-app 
 
This repo ontains code for my to-do App. In order to use the app you have to type in the name of your task, and its due date. After that, there is a call for a action button that allows you to add your newly created task to your list of tasks. You can delete, edit and also mark off the created tasks as completed by pressing the buttons besides the task. As you create the tasks, they are saved to your local storage.
